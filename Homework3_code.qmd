```{r}
#| include: false
library(tidyverse)
```

## Task 1

### Part a

We have our data in the appropriate folder. So, we will start by looking into using `read_csv()` to load in our data.

```{r}
#| eval: false
?read_csv
```

We are not able to use this function specifically, because this file is delimited by `;` and not a comma. We are able to use the `read_csv2()` function for semicolon delimited data. So, we will use this to read in our data below.

```{r}
data <- read_csv2("./data/data.txt",
          col_names = TRUE)
data
```

### Part b

Next, we will load in the `6` delimited data with an empty row. This should look the same as the data above when finished loading it in.

```{r}

```

## Task 2

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
